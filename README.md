# inventory-management-program

Harry Newman

This is a project I created in a group setting in my Introduction to Computer Science class, in which we created a Warehouse Inventory Management program where customers can purchase items and managers can keep track of items and restock them using Java.  My part of the project was to create the Login system, as well as the customer side of the program.  I created a database to store login information of both customers and managers, added a way to create new accounts, and created a portal where customers could purchase items and change their usernames and passwords if they wanted to.
 
This code has some bugs and problems, two of my group members did basically none of the work which left me and another person to attempt to finish the project on our own.
